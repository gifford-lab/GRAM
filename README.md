# GRAM

The GRAM (Genetic RegulAtory Modules) algorithm identifies modules, collections of genes
that share common regulators, as well as expression profiles.

<b>Abstract</b>We
describe an algorithm for discovering regulatory networks 
of gene modules, GRAM (Genetic Regulatory Modules), that
combines information from genome-wide location and
expression data sets. A gene module is defined as a set of
coexpressed genes to which the same set of transcription
factors binds. Unlike previous approaches
1â€“5
that relied
primarily on functional information from expression data, 
the GRAM algorithm explicitly links genes to the factors that
regulate them by incorporating DNA binding data, which
provide direct physical evidence of regulatory interactions. 
We
use the GRAM algorithm to describe a genome-wide
regulatory network in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
using 
binding information for 106 transcription factors profiled 
in rich medium conditions and data from over 500 expression
experiments. We also present a genome-wide location analysis
data set for regulators in yeast cells treated with rapamycin,
and use the GRAM algorithm to provide biological insights into
this regulatory network.</b>
